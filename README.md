Health Monitor - MERN Stack Application
Project Overview
Health Monitor is a real-time healthcare monitoring system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It enables doctors and patients to monitor vital signs, view patient histories, and get alerts for abnormal health conditions remotely.

This project addresses the need for continuous patient monitoring, remote diagnostics, and proactive alerting to improve healthcare outcomes.

Features
Role-based Access: Separate dashboards and functionalities for Doctors and Patients.

Real-Time Monitoring: Live updates of key vitals (heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, temperature, blood pressure) via WebSockets.

Alert System: Automated alerts for abnormal vitals, visible to both patients and doctors.

Patient Management: Doctors can monitor multiple patients and access their historical data.

Historical Data: Comprehensive vitals history presented in tables for trend tracking.

Secure Authentication: Registration and login with JWT-based authentication.

Responsive UI: Clean, modern, and accessible frontend built with React.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Router, Context API

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

Auth: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Real-time: WebSocket communication via Socket.io

Styling: CSS with modular/scoped style sheets
